# MATLAB Utils

This repository MATLAB basic functions that are in MATLAB Toolboxes, but probably should be in the main package. For example, the [`prctile`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/prctile.html) function is quite basic, but requires the "Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox" to use.

The functions in this repository follow the same API as the identically named official functions, but often they do not completely implement the API.
